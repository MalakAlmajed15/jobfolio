# 🎬 Project 4: JobFolio

## 📝 Introduction  

**JobFolio** is a full-stack web application designed to help job seekers organize and track their job applications efficiently. The platform allows users to manage companies, job positions, and applications in one place. It streamlines the job search process with structured forms, status tracking, resume uploads, and detailed notes, keeping everything centralized and easy to manage.  

### Why I Built It  
I built **JobFolio** to provide a single, intuitive dashboard where users can:  
- Track application statuses (Applied, Interviewed, Offer, Rejected).  
- Maintain company and job position details.  
- Upload resumes for each application.  
- Stay organized with a clean and user-friendly interface.
